# HerbGarden.html
A project for me to show my html skills. 

I started this project to work on my html skills and feel more comfortable on the command line.

Using github and git commands, I am able to save my work as well.

I have become quite fond of html, the more I work on my webpages, the more I enjoy it.

Using new tags, such as the tale tags were a really good way for me to expand the knowledge I have of HTML.
